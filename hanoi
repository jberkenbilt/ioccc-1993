    The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle consisting of several rings
    of various sizes and three posts.  Each ring is a different
    size.  The initial configuration of the game is that all the
    rings are stacked in decreasing order of size on one post.
    The object of the game is to move all the rings from one
    post to another subject to two rules: only one ring can be
    moved at a time, and at no time can one ring be placed on
    top of a smaller ring.  The number of steps necessary to
    sovle this puzzle is exponential in the number rings.
