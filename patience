    The Patience puzzle, probably of Chinese origin, consists of
    an iron U-shaped piece and several rings that link around
    it.  The physical shape of the puzzle is very difficult to
    describe verbally, but here is an attempt.

    This description of the puzzle is presented as a set of
    instructions for constructing the puzzle.  Start with a flat
    piece of iron about 15 centimeters long by about two
    centimeters wide.  Drill six holes in the piece of iron.
    Through each hole, place a rod.  The rod should have a
    diameter slightly less than that of the hole so that it can
    move freely.  One end of the rod is like the head of a nail
    and is larger than the hole to prevent it from coming free.
    The other end is looped around a metal ring with a diameter
    of about five centimeters.  This completely prevents the
    iron rod from separating from the base.  What has been
    described so far is one of the two components of the puzzle.

    The other component is another iron rod shaped like a U.
    the U is as long from the tips to the base as the original
    piece of iron with the holes in it.  The ends of the U are
    looped around another ring of about five centimeters in
    diameter.  In the puzzle's initial configuration, the U is
    placed through the rings so that it is held in place by the
    iron rods.  Imagine starting with the U piece before the
    iron loop is placed at the end.  Slide the legs of the U
    through the loops so that the iron rods securing the loops
    to the metal strip go up the center of the U.  Placing the
    final ring at the ends of the U prevents it from coming out.
    The object of the puzzle is to free the U-shaped piece from
    the other piece.

    The following illustration is NOT exactly like the puzzle,
    but it will serve to clarify the puzzle's construction.  In
    this picture, you can see that the first ring could be
    lifted over the edge of the U and slide down through the
    center of the U, thereby freeing the U from the first iron
    rod and making the second ring free to move.  In the
    configuration shown, the second ring couldn't move because
    it would be blocked by the first ring.  The Patience puzzle
    is constructed basically this way except that the second
    ring goes over the iron rod the first ring is attached to,
    the third ring goes over the second ring's rod, etc.  Thus,
    in the real puzzle, the first and second rings are free to
    move but the third ring is constrained in a manner similar
    to the second ring in this illustration.

    This puzzle takes other forms as well.  Two puzzles with the
    identical solution that are of completely different physical
    shapes are one in which the puzzle consists one plastic
    piece with another that slides in and out of it.  The
    movement of the smaller piece is restricted by discs that,
    when turned to one angle, lock the smaller piece inside the
    larger one and, when turned the other way, allow it to move.
    This puzzle is as difficult to describe as the first and,
    since I don't have one in front of me, I will not attempt to
    describe it.  The other puzzle that is like this one
    consists of a cylinder with rods protruding from the top.
    The rods can be slid from the center to the edge of the
    cylinder constrained by a series of discs in the center.
    The discs have cuts in them that allow some rods to move and
    force others in one place based on the relative rotations of
    the discs.  The object here is to move all the rods from the
    inside to the outside.

    What makes these puzzles similar is that the physical shapes
    of the puzzle put the same restriction on the movement of
    the pieces.  Specifically, there is always one piece that is
    free to move.  The only other piece that is free to move is
    the second one that is still attached to the base it is
    trying to be freed from.  In the case of the original
    puzzle, consider the rings numbered from 1 to 6 with ring 1
    being the one at the closed send of the U.  Ring 1 can
    always be removed from around the ring.  In the initial
    state, when all rings are around the U, ring 2 is the other
    one that can be moved because it is second.  If ring 1 is
    removed, then only two operations are possible: the
    restoration of ring 1 and the removal of ring 3.  This is
    because ring 1 is always movable, and ring 3 is currently
    the second ring still attached to the U.  This constraint
    leads to a recursive solution to the puzzle.  Like the
    Towers of Hanoi, the number of steps to solve this puzzle is
    exponential in the number of rings.
